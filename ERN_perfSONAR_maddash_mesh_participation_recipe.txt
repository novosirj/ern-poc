Title: Instructions for joining a perfSONAR measurement host to the ERN mesh and visualization grid
Rev.: 1.0
Date: 7/25/2018
perfSONAR host versions: 4.1
OS: CentOS 7

---------------------------------------------


A. If you have an existing perfSONAR measurement host(s) with version 4.1:

  Step 1: Send a mesh provisioning request to tech@hpc.rutgers.edu including the hostnames of your measurement hosts and responsible sysadmins. E.g.:


  hostname: perfsonarny.myren.org
  location: New York, NY
  administrators: Alice (alice@myren.org), Bob (bob@myren.org)

  hostname: perfsonarma.myren.org
  location: Boston, MA
  administrators: Alice (alice@myren.org), Bob (bob@myren.org)



  Step 2: version 4.1 - On each of your measurement hosts run the following command:

 psconfig remote add --configure-archives "https://mesh.hpc.rutgers.edu/psconfig/northeastmesh.json"


  *Note: You can have multiple psconfig remote lines to participate in multiple meshes


  Step 3: Copy firewalld perfsonar service file

 copy ern-poc/fedconfig/perfsonar.xml /etc/firewalld/services

  Step 4: Reboot the measurement host so all services start properly and the firewall restarts


B. If you need to build a new measurement host from scratch you can follow the guidelines below to install perfSONAR on a dedicated hardware appliance:
